<p>In 2018, over 80 friends of the Olympia Baseball Program, led by anchor sponsor <a href='https://www.olyortho.com/'>Olympia Orthopaedic Associates</a>, donated
  nearly $100,000 for the construction of the Todd McDougall Memorial Hitting facility. We broke ground on October 9 at a ceremony attended by members of the McDougall
  family, current and former players and coaches, and friends of the program.  Two months later, on December 8, a work party of parents and players hung the nets
  and donor wall, and the facility was opened for workouts.  Through the rain and snow of the winter months, players have used the facility just about every day to
  hone their game for the upcoming season.</p>
