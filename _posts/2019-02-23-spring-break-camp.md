Olympia Baseball Program players and coaches are excited to host the annual Spring Break baseball camp for
youth aged 6-14.  The camp will be held from 9 am to noon each day, Monday-Wednesday April 1-3, at Olympia
High School.

This camp is always a lot of fun for young players, and provides instruction on the skills and drills taught
in the program at Olympia.  Spots are limited so sign up soon (kids who register before March 25 will receive
  a camp t-shirt)!

Download the [order form]({{'/spring-break-camp-2019-form.pdf' | relative_url }}) and mail it with your
check to reserve your player's place in the camp.
