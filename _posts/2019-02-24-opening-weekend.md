At 7:00 pm on Friday, March 1, players will gather with their families and coaches for the annual First Pitch potluck dinner.  Coach Weldon
will formally introduce the players and coaches, and former Washington State University head coach Don Marbut will speak on Championship Culture.

We're asking families to contribute food to the potluck based upon the player's graduating class:

* Seniors: Drinks
* Juniors: Dessert
* Sophomores: Main Dish
* Freshmen: Sides

We are planning a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 1:30 pm on Saturday, March 2, to mark the official opening of the Todd McDougall
Memorial Hitting Facility. Intrasquad games will follow the ceremony, for anyone who would like to stay and watch some baseball
on Crandall Field! Given the unpredictability of early March weather in Olympia, these times are subject to change. Follow
the Olympia Baseball [twitter account](https://twitter.com/BaseballOlympia) for updates on the schedule of activities.

We look forward to a fun-filled weekend to launch the Bears' 2019 campaign!
